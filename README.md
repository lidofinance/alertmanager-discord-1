Converts Prometheus Alertmanager webhook to Discord webhook.

## Usage

Default port to listen on is 5001 and can be configured by environment variable `PORT`.

Store configuration at `/etc/alertmanager-discord.yml` file e.g.:

```yaml
hooks:
  - slug: collaterals-monitoring
    hook: https://discord.com/api/webhook/123
  - slug: balval-alerts
    hook: https://discord.com/api/webhook/456
  - slug: automation-eng
    hook: https://discord.com/api/webhook/789
```

Configure alertmanager to send alerts to the related hook:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: "collaterals-monitoring"
    webhook_configs:
      - url: "http://alertmanager-discord:5001/hook/collaterals-monitoring"
        send_resolved: false

  - name: "balval-alerts"
    webhook_configs:
      - url: "http://alertmanager-discord:5001/hook/balval-alerts"
```

## Additional features

#### Discord users mentions

Provide `mentions` alert's label value to mention arbitrary Discord user:

```yaml
mentions: <user_id_0>,<user_id_1>
```

User ID may be found on Discord by **Copy ID** context menu item available with
developer mode is turned on.

#### Title and description templating

Provide `TITLE_TMPL` and `DESCR_TMPL` to override title and/or description, e.g. in docker-compose:

```yaml
environment:
  TITLE_TMPL: >
    {{@if(it.status==='resolved'}}
    {{it.annotations.onResolved|d('')}}
    {{/if}}
```

If template is evaluating to an empty string, `annotations.summary` and `annotations.description` fields
will be used for title and description respectivelly.

Look at [squirrelly](https://squirrelly.js.org) docs for templating reference.

#### Inline fields

Provide `inline_fields` alert's annotation to insert the inline fields with the values provided by the markdown list:

```yaml
inline_fields: |
  - hello
  - there
```

## Alternative working mode

If you want to use this service in alternative working mode, you can provide `WORKING_MODE` environment variable.
For docker-compose it may look like this:
```yaml
environment:
  WORKING_MODE: "alternative"
```
It will allow you to describe alerts in the following way:
```yaml
      - alert: NumValidatorsWithNegativeDelta
        expr: ethereum_validators_monitoring_validator_count_with_negative_balances_delta > 0 AND ON() changes(ethereum_validators_monitoring_epoch_number[1m]) > 0
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          emoji: 💸
          summary: 'Operators have a negative balance delta'
          resolved_summary: 'Operators have a positive balance delta'
          description: 'Number of validators per operator who have a negative balance delta.'
          resolved_description: 'Number of validators per operator who recovered.'
          field_name: '{{ $labels.nos_name }}'
          field_value: '[{{ $value | printf "%.0f" }}](http://127.0.0.1:8082/d/3wimU2H7h/nodeoperators/?var-nos_name_var={{ urlquery $labels.nos_name }}&from={{ with query "(time() - 1200) * 1000" }}{{ . | first | value | printf "%f" }}{{ end }}&to={{ with query "time() * 1000" }}{{ . | first | value | printf "%f" }}{{ end }})'
          url: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/d/HRgPmpNnz/validators"
          footer_text: 'Epoch • {{ with query "ethereum_validators_monitoring_epoch_number" }}{{ . | first | value | printf "%.0f" }}{{ end }}'
          footer_icon_url: "https://cryptologos.cc/logos/steth-steth-logo.png"
```
And it will produce the following result:

1. When action execution is finished, navigate to Repo => Pull requests
1. Find pull request named "chore(release): X.X.X" review and merge it with "Rebase and merge" (or "Squash and merge")
